<h1><a name="SecurityManager-UnderstandingtheSecurityManagerinApacheShiro"></a>Understanding the SecurityManager in Apache Shiro</h1>

<p>The <a class="external-link" href="static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/mgt/SecurityManager.html">SecurityManager</a> lies at the heart of Shiro's architecture.  While the <a href="subject.html" title="Subject">Subject</a> represents security functionality and state for a <em>single</em> application user, the <tt>SecurityManager</tt> performs security operations and manages state for <em>all</em> application users.</p>

<p>Because Shiro's API encourages a <tt>Subject</tt>-centric programming approach, most application developers will rarely, if ever, interact with the <tt>SecurityManager</tt> directly (framework developers however might sometimes find it useful). Even so, it is still important to know how the <tt>SecurityManager</tt> functions, especially when configuring one for an application.</p>

<h2><a name="SecurityManager-Design"></a>Design</h2>

<p>As stated previously, the application's <tt>SecurityManager</tt> performs security operations and manages state for <em>all</em> application users.  In Shiro's default <tt>SecurityManager</tt> implementations, this includes:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Authentication</li>
	<li>Authorization</li>
	<li>Session Management</li>
	<li>Cache Management</li>
	<li><a href="realm.html" title="Realm">Realm</a> coordination</li>
	<li>Event propagation</li>
	<li>"Remember Me" Services</li>
	<li>Subject creation</li>
	<li>Logout<br clear="none">and more.</li></ul>

<p>But this is a lot of functionality to try to manage in a single component.  And, making these things flexible and customizable would be very difficult if everything were lumped into a single implementation class.  </p>

<p>To simplify configuration and enable flexible configuration/pluggability, Shiro's implementations are all highly modular in design - so modular in fact, that the SecurityManager implementation (and its class-hierarchy) does not do much at all.  Instead, the <tt>SecurityManager</tt> implementations mostly act as a lightweight 'container' component, delegating almost all behavior to nested/wrapped components.</p>

<h3><a name="SecurityManager-Modularity"></a>Modularity</h3>

<p>To simplify the <tt>SecurityManager</tt> implementation complexity and allow for pluggable behavior, the Shiro <tt>SecurityManager</tt> implementations delegate almost all logic to a nested set of modular components that actually perform the necessary functionality.  While the components actually execute the logic, the <tt>SecurityManager</tt> implementation knows how and when to coordinate the components for the correct behavior.</p>

<p>The nested components that the <tt>SecurityManager</tt> coordinates and delegates to are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Authenticator (<tt>org.apache.shiro.authc.Authenticator</tt>)</li>
	<li>Authorizer (<tt>org.apache.shiro.authz.Authorizer</tt>)</li>
	<li>SessionManager (<tt>org.apache.shiro.session.mgt.SessionManager</tt>)</li>
	<li><a href="cachemanager.html" title="CacheManager">CacheManager</a> (<tt>org.apache.shiro.cache.CacheManager</tt>)</li>
	<li>RememberMeManager  (<tt>org.apache.shiro.mgt.RememberMeManager</tt>)</li>
	<li>SubjectFactory(<tt>org.apache.shiro.mgt.SubjectFactory</tt>)</li></ul>


<p>The <tt>SecurityManager</tt> implementations and are also JavaBeans compatible, which allows you (or a configuration mechanism) to easily customize the pluggable components via standard JavaBeans accessor/mutator methods (get*/set*).  This means the Shiro's architectural modularity can translate into very easy configuration for custom behavior.</p>

#tip('Easy Configuration', 'Because of JavaBeans compatibility, it is very easy to configure the <tt>SecurityManager</tt> with custom components via any mechanism that supports JavaBeans-style configuration, such as <a href="spring.html" title="Spring">Spring</a>, Guice, JBoss, etc.')

<h3><a name="SecurityManager-ProgrammaticConfiguration"></a>Programmatic Configuration</h3>

<p>The absolute simplest way to create a SecurityManager and make it available to the application is to create a <tt>org.apache.shiro.mgt.DefaultSecurityManager</tt> and wire it up in code:</p>

<div class="code panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><div class="codeContent panelContent">
<pre class="code-java">
Realm realm = <span class="code-comment">//instantiate or acquire a Realm instance.  We'll discuss Realms later.
</span><span class="code-object">SecurityManager</span> securityManager = <span class="code-keyword">new</span> DefaultSecurityManager(realm);
<span class="code-comment">//Make the <span class="code-object">SecurityManager</span> instance available to the entire application:
</span>SecurityUtils.setSecurityManager(securityManager);
</pre>
</div></div>

<p>Surprisingly, after only 3 lines of code, you now have a fully functional Shiro environment suitable for most applications.  How easy was that!?</p>

<p>You could additionally call any of the <tt>SecurityManager</tt> instance's setter methods with custom implementations of the nested components listed above to fully customize its behavior.</p>

<p>But, as simple as programmatic customization is, these 3 lines of code do not represent the ideal configuration for most real world applications.  There are a few reasons why programmatic configuration may not be suitable for your application:</p>

<ol><li>It requires you to know about and instantiate a direct implementation.  It would be nicer if you didn't have to know about concrete implementations and where to find them.</li><li>The <tt>SecurityUtils.setSecurityManager</tt> method call makes the instantiated <tt>SecurityManager</tt> instance a VM static singleton, which, while fine for many applications, would cause problems if more than one Shiro-enabled application was running on the same JVM.  It could be better if the instance was an application singleton, but not a static memory reference.</li><li>It requires you to recompile your application every time you want to make a Shiro configuration change.</li></ol>


<p>Most applications instead benefit from text-based configuration that could be modified independently of source code and even make things easier to understand for those not intimately familiar with Shiro's APIs.  </p>

<h3><a name="SecurityManager-TextConfiguration"></a>Text Configuration</h3>

<p>Shiro provides a simple INI-based <a href="configuration.html" title="Configuration">configuration</a> that can be used out of the box, but any other JavaBeans-compatible mechanism can be used as well.  For example, Shiro has excellent <a href="spring.html" title="Spring">Spring support</a> too.  Other similar frameworks (Guice, JBoss, etc) could also be used.</p>
