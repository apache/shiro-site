= Apache Shiro Site: Contributing

== General guidelines

* New files are written in AsciiDoc, using `.adoc` filename extensions.
* Each sentence ends with a newline (`\n`).
Git will automatically convert line endings for you.


== Changes for a new Apache Shiro Release

=== Changes to link:src/site/content/download.adoc[]

* Update the header attribute `:jbake-releases: {"versions":["shiro19x"]}`.
* Keep the `x` at the end, as we only promote the latest bugfix release for a given minor version.

=== Changes to link:data/releases.yaml[]

* Change `latestRelease: "..."` to the new version.
* Update the `versionInfo` object accordingly. +
You can just add a new release, there is no need to remove old releases.
* Update the `oldReleases`/`releases` variable:
** If the new `latestRelease` is a new minor release (e.g. `1.n.0`, where `n` is the new minor release version), prepend the old version to the `oldReleases` array. +
Also, add it to the 'releases' object at the end of the file as `1nx`.
** If the new `latestRelease` is a bugfix release (e.g. `1.n.x`), update the version number of the `releases` object at the end of the file. +
_Rationale:_ Every minor release should only be represented with the latest bugfix release.

=== Changes to link:data/artifacts.yaml[]

In the unlikely event that new artifacts were generated, please modify link:data/artifacts.yaml[] according to your needs. +
Do not delete artifacts, as they may be in use for old versions.

After modifying the artifacts file, update the `releases` object in link:data/releases.yaml[] to include the new artifact's name.

=== Changes to link:src/site/assets/.htaccess[]

Look for hard coded versions and replace them.

Unfortunately, JBake does not allow custom types.
For this reason, templating is not available for `.htaccess` files.

== Development server

To start a development server on http://localhost:8820, use this command:
