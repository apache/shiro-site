Apache Shiro's JAX-RS support is built on top of the more general link:web.html[Servlet] support, and requires Shiro's Servlet Filter to be setup. The Servlet Filter can be setup by using Shiro's Servlet fragment, `web.xml` configuration, or programmatically.

== Dependencies

Include the `shiro-servlet-plugin` and `shiro-jaxrs` dependencies in you application classpath (we recommend using a tool such as Apache Maven or Gradle to manage this).

NOTE: This is not required if using Jakarta EE module


For information on other ways to set up the Apache Shiro Filter see the link:web.html[web documentation].

== Configuration

There are two basic approaches used to define the authentication and authorization for your JAX-RS resources: paths defined statically in configuration, or via annotations on your resource.

If you are using link:guice.html[Guice] or link:spring.html[Spring] see those docs on how to configure Shiro.

=== Paths defined in `shiro.ini`

Just like any other web application, your resources paths can be defined in a `shiro.ini` file. For example, to require resources under `/api/secured` to use basic authentication, your `[urls]` section would look like:

[source,ini]
----
[urls]

/api/secured/** = authcBasic

----

See the link:web.html[web documentation] for more details.

The other, probably more popular, option is to use Shiro's link:java-annotations-list.html[annotations] alongside other JAX-RS annotations on your resources. However, you *MUST* still define at least one path in your `shiro.ini` file.

The below code block will allow for basic authentication but NOT require it (via the `permissive` flag). This way all the resources under `/api` can optional require authentication and authorization based on annotations.

[source,ini]
----
[urls]

/api/** = authcBasic[permissive]

----

=== Jakarta EE Security Annotations (JSR-250)
In addition to all Shiro annotations, Jax-RS module allows to specify Jakarta EE security annotations such as `@RolesAllowed`, `@DenyAll` and `@PermitAll` on your Jax-RS Endpoints.

[#principal_propagation]]
=== Principal Propagation
If calling remote EJBs, for example, the container security mechanism might interpret `java.security.Principal` and will error the remote EJB call as unauthenticated.
If Jax-RS is used in conjunction with the link:jakarta-ee.html[Jakarta EE] module, the principal propagation is configured by Jakarta EE. However, if Jax-RS module is used standalone, principal propagation can be disabled by adding a configuration property to the map as illustrated below:
[source,java]
----
@ApplicationPath("/api")
public class JaxRsApplication extends Application {
    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getProperties() {
        return Map.of(SHIRO_WEB_JAXRS_DISABLE_PRINCIPAL_PARAM, Boolean.TRUE);
    }
}
----

== Example

To create a simple example we can define a JAX-RS resource `HelloShiro`:

[source,java]
----
@Path("/shiro")
public class HelloShiro {

  @GET
  @RequiresUser
  public String sayHelloShiro() {
      return "Hello!";
  }

  @GET
  @Path("define")
  @RequiresPermissions("hello:define")
  public String defineShiro() {
      return  "Shiro is the Japanese term for a castle";
  }
}
----

This resource has two end points, the first allows access by any logged-in user, the second any user with the link:permissions.html[permission] `hello:define`.

The corresponding JAX-RS Application class:

[source,java]
----
@ApplicationPath("/api")
public class ExampleApp extends Application {

@Override
    public Set<Class<?>> getClasses() {
        Set<Class<?>> classes = new HashSet<>();

        // register the Shiro Feature
        classes.add(ShiroFeature.class);

        // register resources:
        classes.add(HelloShiro.class);

        return classes;
    }
}
----

The `ShiroFeature` does three things:

* configures exception mapping from Shiro's `AuthorizationException` to HTTP status codes (401 and 403)
* exposes Shiro's `Subject` as a `java.security.Principal` (link:jakarta-ee.html#principal_propagation[Principal Propagation])
* Configures processing of Shiro's annotations

In the above example, requests to either `/api/shiro` or `/api/shiro/define` will return an HTTP status of `401` if a user is not currently logged in. A request to `/api/shiro/define` made by a user without the `hello:define` will return a `403`.
