The Shiro team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Shiro version 1.9.0.
This is a feature release for 1.x.

This release solves 20 issues since the 1.8.0 release and is available for download now.

== Breaking changes

* We fixed [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/SHIRO-829[SHIRO-829]] by changing the class signature of the class `ShiroFilterFactoryBean`:
+
[source,diff]
----
-public class ShiroFilterFactoryBean implements FactoryBean, BeanPostProcessor {
+public class ShiroFilterFactoryBean implements FactoryBean<AbstractShiroFilter>, BeanPostProcessor {
----
+
and the method signature of `public Class<?> getObjectType`:
+
[source,diff]
----
-    public Class getObjectType() {
-        return SpringShiroFilter.class;
+    public Class<?> getObjectType() {
+        return AbstractShiroFilter.class;
----

While we do not expect to break any builds or runtimes, these changes are (strictly speaking) breaking changes as they introduce Generics to this class.
