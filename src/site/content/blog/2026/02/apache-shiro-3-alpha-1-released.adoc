The Apache Shiro team is pleased to announce the release of Apache Shiro version 3.0.0-alpha-1.

This release is available for download now.

== Release Highlights

* Java 17 is the minimum requirement
* Using Scoped values instead of ThreadLocals on JDK 25+
* Jakarta EE 11, Spring 7 and SpringBoot 4 without classifiers, dropped support for Jakarta EE 8, SpringBoot 2 and javax namespace
* Removed many deprecations
* Refactored code to use Java 17+ features


The reason this is still an Alpha release is because we are still unsure of further API stability, but the release is in a good enough state to try out with your current projects.
