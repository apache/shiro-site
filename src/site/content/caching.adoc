The Shiro development team understands performance is critical in many
applications. Caching is a first class feature built into Shiro from day
one to ensure that security operations remain as fast as possible.

However, while Caching as a concept is a fundamental part of Shiro,
implementing a full Cache mechanism would be outside the core competency
of a security framework. To that end, Shiro’s cache support is basically
an abstraction (wrapper) API that will '`sit`' on top of an underlying
production Cache mechanism (e.g. Hazelcast, Ehcache, OSCache,
Terracotta, Coherence, GigaSpaces, JBossCache, etc). This allows a Shiro
end-user to configure any cache mechanism they prefer.

== Caching API

Shiro has three important cache interfaces:

* link:static/current/apidocs/shiro-cache/org/apache/shiro/cache/CacheManager.html[`+CacheManager+`]
- The primary Manager component for all caching, it returns `+Cache+`
instances.
* link:static/current/apidocs/shiro-cache/org/apache/shiro/cache/Cache.html[`+Cache+`]
- Maintains key/value pairs
* link:static/current/apidocs/shiro-cache/org/apache/shiro/cache/CacheManagerAware.html[`+CacheManagerAware+`]
- Implemented by components wishing to receive and use a CacheManager
instance

A `+CacheManager+` returns `+Cache+` instances and various Shiro
components use those `+Cache+` instances to cache data as necessary. Any
Shiro component that implements `+CacheManagerAware+` will automatically
receive a configured `+CacheManager+`, where it can be used to acquire
`+Cache+` instances.

The Shiro link:securitymanager.html[SecurityManager] implementations and
all
link:static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/AuthenticatingRealm.html[`+AuthenticatingRealm+`]
and
link:static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/AuthorizingRealm.html[`+AuthorizingRealm+`]
implementations implement CacheManagerAware. If you set the
`+CacheManager+` on the `+SecurityManager+`, it will in turn set it on
the various Realms that implement CacheManagerAware as well (OO
delegation). For example, in shiro.ini:

[source,ini]
.example shiro.ini CacheManager configuration
----
securityManager.realms = $myRealm1, $myRealm2, ..., $myRealmN
...
cacheManager = my.implementation.of.CacheManager
...
securityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager
# at this point, the securityManager and all CacheManagerAware
# realms have been set with the cacheManager instance
----

== CacheManager Implementations

Shiro provides a number of out-of-the-box `+CacheManager+`
implementations that you might find useful instead of implementing your
own.

=== `+MemoryConstrainedCacheManager+`

The
link:static/current/apidocs/shiro-cache/org/apache/shiro/cache/MemoryConstrainedCacheManager.html[`+MemoryConstrainedCacheManager+`]
is a `+CacheManager+` implementation suitable for single-JVM production
environments.
It is not clustered/distributed, so if your application spans across more than one JVM (e.g. web app running on multiple web servers), and you want cache entries to be accessible across JVMs, you will need to use a distributed cache implement instead.

The `+MemoryConstrainedCacheManager+` manages link:static/current/apidocs/shiro-cache/org/apache/shiro/cache/MapCache.html[`+MapCache+`] instances, one `+MapCache+` instance per named cache.
Each `+MapCache+` instance is backed by a Shiro link:static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/util/SoftHashMap.html[`+SoftHashMap+`] which can auto-resize itself based on an application’s runtime memory constraints/needs (by leveraging JDK https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/ref/SoftReference.html[`+SoftReference+`] instances).

Because the `+MemoryConstrainedCacheManager+` can auto-resize itself
based on an application’s memory profile, it is safe to use in a
single-JVM production application as well as for testing needs. However,
it does not have more advanced features suche as cache entry
Time-to-Live or Time-to-Expire settings.
For these more advanced cache  management features, you’ll likely want to use one of the more advanced `+CacheManager+` offerings below.

[source,ini]
.MemoryConstrainedCacheManager shiro.ini configuration example
----
...
cacheManager = org.apache.shiro.cache.MemoryConstrainedCacheManager
...
securityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager
----

== `+HazelcastCacheManager+`

TBD

== `+EhCacheManager+`

TBD

== Authorization Cache Invalidation

Finally, note that
link:static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/AuthorizingRealm.html[`+AuthorizingRealm+`]
has a
link:static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/AuthorizingRealm.html#clearCachedAuthorizationInfo(org.apache.shiro.subject.PrincipalCollection)[clearCachedAuthorizationInfo
method] that can be called by subclasses to evict the cached authzInfo
for a particular account. It is usually called by custom logic if the
corresponding account’s authz data has changed (to ensure the next authz
check will pick up the new data).
