== Reporting a vulnerability

We strongly encourage people to report security vulnerabilities privately to our security list before disclosing them in a public forum.

Please note that the e-mail address below should only be used for reporting undisclosed security vulnerabilities in Apache Shiro and managing the process of fixing such vulnerabilities.
We cannot accept regular bug reports or other queries at this address.

link:mailto:security@shiro.apache.org[security@shiro.apache.org]

== Vulnerability Handling Process

An overview of the vulnerability handling process is:

* The reporter reports the vulnerability privately to link:mailto:security@shiro.apache.org[security@shiro.apache.org].
* The Apache Shiro PMC team works privately with the reporter to resolve the vulnerability.
* A new release of the Apache Shiro concerned is made that includes the fix.
* The vulnerability is publicly announced.

A https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html[more detailed description of the process] has been written for committers. Reporters of security vulnerabilities may also find it useful.

== Apache Shiro Vulnerability Reports

=== link:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46749[CVE-2023-46749]

Apache Shiro before 1.13.0 or 2.0.0-alpha-4, may be susceptible to a path traversal attack that results in an authentication bypass when used together with path rewriting

**Mitigation:** Update to Apache Shiro 1.13.0+ or 2.0.0-alpha-4+, or ensure `blockSemicolon` is enabled (this is the default).

=== link:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-46750[CVE-2023-46750]

URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') vulnerability when "form" authentication is used in Apache Shiro.

**Mitigation:** Update to Apache Shiro 1.13.0+ or 2.0.0-alpha-4+.

=== link:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-34478[CVE-2023-34478]

Apache Shiro, before 1.12.0 or 2.0.0-alpha-3, may be susceptible to a path traversal attack that results in an authentication bypass when used together with APIs or other web frameworks that route requests based on non-normalized requests.

**Mitigation:** Update to Apache Shiro 1.12.0+ or 2.0.0-alpha-3+.

Apache Shiro would like to thank *swifty tk* for reporting this issue.

=== link:https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-22602[CVE-2023-22602]

When using Apache Shiro before 1.11.0 together with Spring Boot 2.6+, a specially crafted HTTP request may cause an authentication bypass.
The authentication bypass occurs when Shiro and Spring Boot are using different pattern-matching techniques. Both Shiro and Spring Boot < 2.6 default to Ant style pattern matching.

**Mitigation:** Update to Apache Shiro 1.11.0, or set the following Spring Boot configuration value:  

```properties
spring.mvc.pathmatch.matching-strategy = ant_path_matcher
```
