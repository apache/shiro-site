== Apache Shiro Cache Manager Overview

Shiro has three important cache interfaces:

* link:static/current/apidocs/shiro-cache/org/apache/shiro/cache/CacheManager.html[`+CacheManager+`]
* link:static/current/apidocs/shiro-cache/org/apache/shiro/cache/Cache.html[`+Cache+`]
* link:static/current/apidocs/shiro-cache/org/apache/shiro/cache/CacheManagerAware.html[`+CacheManagerAware+`]

A `+CacheManager+` returns `+Cache+` instances and various Shiro components use those `+Cache<+` instances to cache data as necessary.
Any Shiro component that implements `+CacheManager+` will automatically receive a configured `+CacheManager+`, where it can be used to acquire `+Cache+` instances.

The Shiro link:securitymanager.html[`+SecurityManager+`] implementations and all
link:static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/AuthorizingRealm.html[`+AuthorizingRealm+`] implementations implement CacheManagerAware.
If you set the `+CacheManager+` on the `+SecurityManager+`, it will in turn set it on the various Realms that implement CacheManagerAware as well (OO delegation).
For example, in shiro.ini:

[source,ini]
.example shiro.ini CacheManager configuration
----
securityManager.realms = $myRealm1, $myRealm2, ..., $myRealmN
...
cacheManager = my.implementation.of.CacheManager
...
securityManager.cacheManager = $cacheManager
# at this point, the securityManager and all CacheManagerAware
# realms have been set with the cacheManager instance
----

We have an out-of-the-box link:static/current/apidocs/shiro-cache/org/apache/shiro/cache/ehcache/EhCacheManager.html[`+EhCacheManager+`] implementation, so you can use that today if you wanted.
Otherwise, you can implement your own `+CacheManager+` (e.g. with Coherence, etc.) and configure it as above, and you’ll be good to go.

== Authorization Cache Invalidation [[CacheManager-AuthorizationCacheInvalidation]]

Finally, note that link:static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/AuthorizingRealm.html[`+AuthorizingRealm+`] has a link:static/current/apidocs/org/apache/shiro/realm/AuthorizingRealm.html#clearCachedAuthorizationInfo%28org.apache.shiro.subject.PrincipalCollection%29[`+clearCachedAuthorizationInfo+`] method that can be called by subclasses to evict the cached authzInfo for a particular account.
It is usually called by custom logic if the corresponding account’s authz data has changed (to ensure the next authz check will pick up the new data).
